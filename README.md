# Concrete-Cracks-image-classification

This project uses a deep learning model to detect cracks in concrete images.

# Key Features:

* Transfer Learning: Leverages a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
* Data Augmentation: Includes image augmentation techniques (flipping, rotation) to improve model robustness.
* Fine-tuning: Fine-tunes the pre-trained model for improved performance on the specific crack detection task.
* Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
* Model Saving: Saves the trained model for future use.

# Prerequisites:

* Python 3.x with TensorFlow 2.x and Keras installed.
* Required libraries: os, keras, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, datetime, shutil, collections, random

# To Run:

1. Prepare Data: Organize your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Run the script: Execute the crack_detection.py script.
3. View Results:
  * View training logs in TensorBoard: tensorboard --logdir=<log_dir>
  * Evaluate model performance in the console.
# Note:

* Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, epochs) for optimal performance.
* Explore data augmentation techniques and model architectures for further improvement.

## This version is more concise and focuses on the key aspects of the project:

 * Project Goal: Crack detection in concrete images.
 * Key Techniques: Transfer learning, data augmentation, model fine-tuning.
 * Prerequisites and Execution Steps: Clear and concise instructions for running the script.
 * Key Features and Considerations: Highlights important aspects of the project.
